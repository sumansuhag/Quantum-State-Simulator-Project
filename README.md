# Quantum-State-Simulator-Project
Classical information is fairly robust; I have CDs and flash drives that have been sitting around for a decade and all the information on them is still perfectly intact. Quantum information, on the other hand, is very fragile. Quantum systems don't like being in definite states (this is prevented by the uncertainty principle).
